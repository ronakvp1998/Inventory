# Vending Machine Program

## Design
The program is designed using an object-oriented approach with a `VendingMachine` class. It has methods to display inventory, update inventory, insert coins, and buy products. The program handles invalid coins and provides change if applicable.

## Running the Program
1. Compile the program using `javac VendingMachine.java VendingMachineTest.java`
2. Run the program using `java VendingMachineTest`

## Tests
The `VendingMachineTest` class contains test cases demonstrating the functionality of the program. It covers scenarios such as displaying inventory, buying a product with exact change, buying a product with insufficient funds, and buying a product with change.

To run the tests, follow the instructions in the "Running the Program" section.
